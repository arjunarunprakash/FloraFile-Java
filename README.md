# My Personal Project: UBCFloraFile

## A tool to catalog your botantical finds 

**What does my application do?**

I want to create a desktop application where a user can 
- *enter* and *keep* a *collection* of botanical finds. 
- specify a *set* of field where they enter in their entry: common name, species name, date, location (limited to UBC Vancouver grounds).
- be able to delete/edit entries. 
- Data is securely saved even when program is closed. 

**Who is this application for?**

This simple application is for anyone that enjoys leisurly walks around the UBC campus, wants to catalog what plant they collected, and write down their thoughts when they see cool flora.

**Why is this Project of Interest to you?**

I want to learn how to create file and registar systems, which has countless applications. I beleive its a unique idea on a subject I have always been passionate about as a LFS student. Having both practical application and being something I will enjoy trying to create.
