# My Personal Project: FloraFile

## A tool to organize and revisit your botantical finds

**What does my application do?**
I want to create a desktop application where a user can *enter* and keep a *collection* of cool botanical finds. They can specify a *set* of details as they journal in their entry, including things like common name, species name, date, location, etc. Ideally, I would like to implement the functionality for the user to be able to see and access their collection, while being able to delete/edit entries if they so please. Furthermore, I need to make sure that the data is securely saved even when my program is closed. These are my current goals for the project but perhaps I can add further functionality depending on how confident I feel in the future.

**Who is this application for?**
This simple application is for anyone that enjoys leisurly walks around their neighborhood, likes collecting plants, wants to keep track of where they saw a cool plant, or someone that just wants to right down their thoughts when they see cool flora.

**Why is this Project of Interest to you?**
I think it'll teach me invaluable information on creating file and registar systems, which has countless applications. Though, if im being honest, I think its a fairly unique idea on a subject I have always been passionate about as a LFS student. It will be something with practical application but also something that I will enjoy trying to create.
